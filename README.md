# GeoQuest AR

## Abstract

GeoQuest AR is a location-based augmented reality (AR) adventure game built with Unity, AR Foundation, and Mapbox.
Players explore real-world locations, discover creatures, capture them in AR, and engage in battles—similar to Pokémon Go.

## Introduction
We utilize Augmented Reality technology combined with a guide and game approach, allowing users who are unsure of how to navigate to their destination upon entering Fu Jen Catholic University's campus to use this app. As users follow the path outlined by the app, they are offered games that involve collecting items and unlocking achievements related to various buildings, thereby learning about the profound and legendary historical stories behind Fu Jen Catholic University.

In the interface of the game and tour, the top right corner displays the level and experience bar. In the bottom right corner, there are three buttons arranged from top to bottom with the functionalities of opening/closing the backpack, activating AR mode, and opening the map, respectively. On the bottom left, there are two buttons: the upper button centers the map, placing the user's location in the middle to easily show where they are; the lower button activates the AR tour assistant, which, upon clicking, displays a drop-down menu for users to select their destination.

### MAP

There are two ways for users to select a destination: the first is to directly click on the destination on the map; the second is to choose the destination through the Dropdown. After executing one of these two methods, the app immediately plans the route and provides navigation for the user.
